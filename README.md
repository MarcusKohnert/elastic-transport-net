# elastic-transport-net

Transport classes and utilities shared among .NET Elastic client libraries

This library was lifted from [elasticsearch-net](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net) and then transformed to be used across all Elastic services rather than only Elasticsearch.


Provides the clients connectivity components, exposes a (potentially) cluster aware request pipeline that can be resilient to nodes dropping in & out of rotation.  
This package is heavily optimized for the Elastic (elastic.co) product suite and Elastic Cloud (cloud.elastic.co) SAAS offering.
